              for implementing the agents' behaviour. The framework makes usage
              of an automated
              <a href="https://planning.wiki/ref/pddl21">PDDL</a> planner for
              computing plans in the means-end reasoning phase. Specifically it

                >PlanSys2</a
              >, a planning system designed and deployed on top of ROS2, taking
              inspiration from what ROSPlan represented for the first
              version of ROS. <br />
              The BDI-PDDL is certainly a synergic duo, allowing to boost the
              adaptability of any agent, so that the course of actions it has to
              take to reach a certain goal are computed at run time based on its
              skillset and the current known environment. Moreover, the
              interactions among different actors have been accounted for and
              properly facilitated, so that the designed agents can reach out to
              their peers whenever the fulfillment of a desire involves an
              ability out of their scope.
              <br /><br />
              The platform is still under development by a research team based in the
              <span class="fw-bold">University of Trento</span>. First results
              are promising, since arisen flaws don’t question in any way the
              strength of the idea, they indeed ignite sparks enlighting the
              steps on the road to realize a viable product for the market,
              ready for the general purpose use in industrial as well as private
              applications. The framework is openly available on github, free, can be tested and used by other
              teams.

            <h4 class="fw-bold">Architecture</h4>

            <p class="text-start">
              The image below represents the typical architecture characterizing
              every running agent in the proposed solution. The structure of
              <span class="fst-italic">agent_n</span> is zoomed, while the ones
              of <span class="fst-italic">agent_s</span> and
              <span class="fst-italic">agent_t</span> are not. However,
              conceptually speaking, they are all the same for what concerns
              their core behaviours and possibilities. All the circles are ROS2
              nodes, the rectangles depict ROS2 topics and the ellipses within
              the red boundaries are PlanSys2’s nodes. Every running ROS2 BDI
              agent is going to have its own independent instance of PlanSys2.
              The <span class="text-green">core nodes</span> are represented by
              the five green circles, while all the
              <span class="text-teal"
                >agent-specific nodes (sensors, actions)</span
              >
              have a teal-blue colored background. While the firsts will always
              be the same five regardless of the agent’s specific tasks, the
              actions and sensors nodes strongly depend on them, hence their
              number and functionalities will differ from agent to agent.
              Nonetheless, it’s true that core nodes expose parameters that will
              allow to properly tune their behaviour, hence the agent’s one with
              respect to the scenario and environment in which it’s put in will
              require. Each topic or service name presents as its prefix the
              <span class="font-monospace">agent_id</span> (in the zoomed case below it'd be "<span class="fst-italic">agent_n</span>"), which is also the
              value of the namespace in which all the respective nodes for the
              agent are loaded. There are topics for beliefs and desires: one
              ”channel” for triggering the addition callback and one for the
              deletion, while another one serves the purpose to regularly notify
              about the current status of the respective desire/belief set. The
              topic
              <span class="font-monospace">/{agent_id}/plan_execution</span> info
              shows updates regarding the currently running plan execution; it
              consists of a special null message (e.g. no action executing,
              empty body plan) if there isn’t any and the agent is in
              idle-state. The topic
              <span class="font-monospace text-danger"
                >/{agent_id}/plansys2_state</span
              >
              state could be considered as a utility extension to PlanSys2 in
              order to make it easier to know if one of its nodes is ”active” or
              not.
